Senior Software Engineer and technical lead, responsible for designing, building, and operating production systems across product and security domains.

I lead development pods, set technical direction, and own delivery end-to-end—from ambiguous problem space to shipped, maintained software.

My current focus is **free and open-source software**: building tools that address recurring, structural pain points across development teams—not just my own.

## Mission (FOSS)

Build open, durable software that reduces cognitive load, replaces brittle process, and respects the craft of engineering.

**Craft over output. Longevity over novelty.**

---

## What I Do

- **Technical leadership**
  - Tech lead for a product development pod
  - Cross-team leadership within a broader security organization
  - Setting standards, reviewing designs, and unblocking execution

- **Full-stack & backend engineering**
  - TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Next.js
  - PostgreSQL, Prisma
  - API design, auth, data modeling

- **Developer tooling**
  - Internal platforms and workflow tooling
  - Making invisible work explicit and maintainable

- **Security-conscious system design**
  - Translating security and compliance requirements into usable systems
  - Balancing rigor with developer velocity

- **Delivery & operations**
  - CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Docker)
  - Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Observability, failure modes, and operational hygiene

## Open Source

### **Nori**
**White-glove i18n management for engineering teams**

An open-source approach to localization that treats i18n as a first-class engineering concern rather than an afterthought.

Focused on:
- reducing friction between engineers and translators
- making localization workflows explicit and auditable
- scaling i18n without turning it into a process tax

(Active development)

## Principles

- Craft over output
- Open systems outlast closed ones
- Explicit contracts prevent downstream pain
- Tests and documentation are part of the deliverable
- If it’s worth building, it’s worth maintaining
